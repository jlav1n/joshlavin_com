appname, extend a Dancer2 app:

My story is that I was working on legacy software, trying to develop a new site. I wanted to make the site as friendly to a future move to Dancer as possible. In hindsight, I should have just taken the leap to Dancer. It would have been less painful than trying to re-invent a lot of functionality my old software had, but I didn't want to embed in my code.


How can I use Dancer in a RESTful way?

How can I make my existing project easier to transition to Dancer?

We'll look at how an existing project was developed with a future Dancer
transition in mind, but why that plan didn't work so well.

* Pain 
    - common pain-point?
* Solution
    - general, high-level solution
* Support
    - supporting points
* something personal and/or humorous
